# RAID Container

AI-first R analysis workspace powered by Dev Containers.

## What You Need

1. **VS Code** (or Codespaces) with the Dev Containers extension.
2. **Docker** running in the background.
3. (Optional) **Codex CLI** or **Claude Code**—pick your favorite co-pilot.

## Launch & Let Agents Work

1. **Clone and open** the repo.
2. **Reopen in Container** when VS Code prompts you; wait for the Rocker image to boot.
3. **Install/launch your agent** inside the container (`codex run`, Claude Code, etc.).
4. **Hand over the task**: once the agent sees the repo, follow the instructions in `AGENTS.md` to keep analyses consistent.

That’s it—after the container starts and your agent connects, you can drive analyses entirely through prompts.
